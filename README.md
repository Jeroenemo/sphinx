#### By _**Jeroen van Seeters, Michael Kriegel, Tyler Sinks**_

## Description

_In order to NOT be eaten by the Sphinx, you must correctly answer three tricky riddles in a row. The prompts &mdash; the whole project, really &mdash; works in the command line. Thus required technology may need to include dotnet scripts..._

# SPECS
Is the riddle displayed to user | - | "Riddle"
Is the users answer correct | answer | "Correct you beat the sphinx"
Is the users answer incorrect | answer | "You were devoured"

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Install the dotnet scripts with the instructions and source code here:
> https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-install-script
* Install .NET Core version 5 or greater here: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework
* _Visit this repository's home at_ https://github.com/Jeroenemo/sphinx
* _Once there, click the green CODE button near the top right_
* _Copy to your clipboard the https link to the repo from the dropdown menu_
* _Use your preferred command line shell or application to bring this whole project to your machine:
> `$ git clone https://github.com/Jeroenemo/sphinx`
* _Then switch into the sphinx directory just created:_
> `$ cd sphinx`
* _Launch your text editor of choice to examine the files. Ideally, you use by default VS Code and can launch the all the files in a go with:_
> `$ code .`
* _In order to take on the Sphinx, switched into the directory (folder) that contains the repository. Then call:_
> `$ dotnet run`

* _Keep in mind, if you lose, the Sphinx eats you._

## Known Bugs
_No known bugs. Please let us know when you've run into one/more._

## Stretch Goals
* _Right now, a player is limited to only three riddles, and these are hard-coded into the project. Perhaps hooking up this command-line prompt-based game to an API riddled with riddles would greatly increase its replay value._
* _Perhaps a splash of color for the text that appears in the console_
* _an ASCII art Sphinx_
* _a welcome screen / instructions at game start_
